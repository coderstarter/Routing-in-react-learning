Your `index.js` file looks mostly correct, but there is one small adjustment to ensure that the routing setup is optimal. You should wrap your `App` component with `BrowserRouter` directly in `index.js`, as you've done. This setup ensures that the routing context is available throughout your entire application.

Here is your `index.js` file, which looks good as it is:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Router>
      <App />
    </Router>
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```

### Explanation:

1. **React.StrictMode**: This is a wrapper that helps to highlight potential problems in an application. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants. This is not related to routing, but itâ€™s good practice to have it in development mode.

2. **BrowserRouter (Router)**: This component wraps around your entire application to provide routing capabilities. It listens to URL changes and renders the corresponding components.

3. **App Component**: Your main application component that contains the routing logic.

### No Further Changes Needed:

- The `index.js` file is correctly set up to include routing.
- The `BrowserRouter` wrapper ensures that routing works as expected.
- All routing logic will be managed inside your `App` component and its children.

This setup is the standard way to initialize routing in a React application using `react-router-dom`. It ensures that all components within `App` and its children can access the routing context.
